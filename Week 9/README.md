    1.  dionaea

**A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.**

    1.  1732 total attacks
    2.  dionaea was the only Honeypot that was attacked
    3.  Top 3 Countries that attacked
        1.  US
        2.  Netherlands
        3.  China

        4.  23
        5.  80
    
**Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected**

Would need more time to see why other honeypots were not attacked.  Would be interesting to leave them on for a longer time period to explore results.
